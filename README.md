# 🚗 Developing Pulse-Based Technologies to Prevent Road Accidents

A C++/Arduino-based safety system that uses real-time pulse monitoring to detect drowsiness or abnormal heart activity in drivers and helps prevent road accidents through alerts and possible intervention mechanisms.

---

## 💡 Problem Statement

Driver fatigue and sudden health issues (like a drop in heart rate) are leading causes of road accidents. This system aims to proactively monitor the driver's pulse using biometric sensors and respond with timely alerts, potentially saving lives.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Measure and monitor the driver’s pulse continuously.
- Detect drowsiness or abnormal pulse patterns (e.g., bradycardia).
- Trigger visual or auditory alerts (buzzer/LED).
- Optionally, control vehicle mechanisms (simulation via relay).

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: C++ (Arduino)
- **Platform**: Arduino Uno / Nano / ESP32
- **Sensor**: Pulse Sensor (e.g., PulseSensor Amped)
- **Actuators**: Buzzer, LEDs, Relay (for demo purposes)
